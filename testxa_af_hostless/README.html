<h2>testxa_af_hostless Audio Software Test Program</h2>

<p>This executable project contains source files, header files and sample 
data and is a test programs for the <b>xa_af_hostless</b> audio software.
It is a managed Xtensa executable project.
See Xplorer Help <b>&quot;Xtensa Xplorer > Concepts > Software Projects&quot;</b> for more details regarding managed Xtensa projects.</p>


<h3>Audio Software Source Package</h3>

<p>If you receive this test program inside the <b>xa_af_hostless</b> audio software source package, then the source code of the library
and documentation are in <b>libxa_af_hostless</b> and possibly some other managed library projects, and this test program 
is configured to depend on those libraries with appropriate build properties.
Building this test program project will automatically build and link-in the
dependent library projects.</p>

<p>The build properties for this project have already been set, and include appropriate 
compiler flags and include directories. Where the values are common to both Debug 
and Release targets, they are set on the Common target; where they differ,
they are set on the appropriate target.<p>

<p>First, select this project, an appropriate HiFi processor configuration and a build target
in the active set toolbar. Then you can Build, Run, Debug or Profile this test program (and its supporting libraries).</p>

<h3>Audio Software Object Package</h3>

<p>If you receive this test program inside the <b>xa_af_hostless</b> audio software object package, 
then the object library (.a) and documentation are in <b>ulibxa_af_hostless</b> and possibly some other unmanaged library projects.</p>

<p>The build properties for this project have already been set, and include appropriate 
compiler flags and include directories. Where the values are common to both Debug 
and Release targets, they are set on the Common target; where they differ,
they are set on the appropriate target.
This project is almost completely configured to build and run with the provided unmanaged libraries, 
just follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Right-click on a library (.a) file in the Project Xplorer and select <b>Unmanaged Binary Info</b>.</li>
	<li>Select the HiFi processor configuration (e.g. 5 or 7 stage) that matches the binary.</li>
	<li>Repeat the above steps for all the dependent libraries.</li>
	<li>Right-click on this project and select <b>Library Dependencies...</b>.</li>
	<li>Add the unmanaged libraries as dependencies of this project by clicking <b>[Add]</b> and <b>[OK]</b>.</li>
	<li>Select the appropriate HiFi processor configuration and a target in the active set toolbar.
</ol>

<p>Note that for Xplorer version 4.0.4 or later,
this project is completely configured to build and run with the provided unmanaged libraries and the steps listed above are not required.
Regardless of your version of Xplorer, you will always see a warning box. This is the way that Xplorer tells you that you are using unmanaged libraries.</p> 


<h3>Switching Between Source and Object Packages</h3>

<p>This project is provided with either the source or object package, and
has been configured appropriately. If you have both, it is easy to switch 
between the different libraries. All you need to do is change the library
dependencies, and switch the include paths to point to the appropriate
library projects. If switching to reference the binary package, see also the
steps described above.</p>

<h3>Running</h3>

<p>Now you can build and run this test program. Select "Open Run Dialog..." and select one
of the two customized launches provided with
this project: cycle accurate mode launch (af_hostless_cycle) or fast functional mode launch (af_hostless_turbo).
Note that many launches do not provide any arguments; they set
the working directory to the location of a default parameter file and run
the program from there. The test program automatically extracts parameters
from that file.</p>
